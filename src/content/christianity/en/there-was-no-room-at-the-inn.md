Christmas is coming and the familiar nativity story will be retold once again, almost certainly including these details:

![There Was No Room at the Inn](/img/no-room-at-the-inn.jpg)

1. Joseph with a pregnant Mary traveled to Bethlehem rushing to find lodging because the baby was due any moment.
2. "There was no room for them in the inn", demonstrated by the empathetic or mean-spirited innkeeper turning them away.
3. Fortunately, a kind stranger or sometimes the innkeeper himself offers them a stable or a cave where Mary gives birth to Jesus.

Except if you read Luke 2, specifically only verses 6-7 that supposedly describe this scene, none of the above is actually stated. So where did these details come from, and are they historically accurate?

## Mary was due to give birth right away?

Luke 2\:6 (NIV) states:

> While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, [](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202%3A6&version=NIV)

The idea that Mary was about to give birth when they arrived in Bethlehem is unlikely because:

1. Censuses in the Roman Empire were not "surprise" inspections. They were announced well in advance and there was plenty of time to prepare for travel [](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census/howourcensusworks/aboutcensuses/censushistory/censustakingintheancientworld).
2. The journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem is approximately 70 miles (112 km), which would take around 4 days on foot. It is unlikely that Mary would have traveled that late in her pregnancy.

## Was there an inn?

### The _"Inn"_ in Luke 2\:7

The ESV and NASB [](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Luke%202%3A7) render Luke 2\:7 as:

> [...] διότι οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς τόπος ἐν τῷ **καταλύματι**.
> 
> [...] because there was no place for them in the **inn**.

The word `kataluma` appears only three times in the New Testament: here,
Luke 22\:11 [](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022%3A11&version=ESV)
and
Mark 14\:14 [](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014%3A14&version=ESV),
both of which refer to the "upper room" where Jesus and his disciples had the Last Supper. The ESV and NASB both translate `κατάλυμα` in these verses as "guest room". Interestingly, the NIV [](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202%3A7&version=NIV) translates `κατάλυμα` in Luke 2\:7 as "guest room".

> [!TIP/FUN FACT]
> They updated it from "inn" to "guest room" in the 2011 revision, you can see the [1984 version here](https://christunite.org/niv-1984-luke)

While `καταλύματι` can refer to an inn or lodging place [](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2646/kjv/tr/0-1/), Luke does use a different Greek word, `πανδοχεῖον`, when referring to an inn in Luke 10\:34[](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010%3A34&version=SBLGNT) (the Parable of the Good Samaritan).

Therefore, _it is unlikely that Luke is referring to a commercial inn in Luke 2\:7_.

### O Little Town of Bethlehem

The town of Bethlehem was a small town. W. F. Albright estimated its population to be around 300 so the _Massacre of the Innocents_ by Herod would have involved killing fewer than a dozen children, explaining why such an event isn't recorded by any contemporary historian.

Therefore, _it is unlikely that Bethlehem would have had a commercial inn to accommodate travelers_.

And if there were no inn, there would be **no innkeeper** to turn Joseph and Mary away.

## What likely happened?

Remember that Joseph and Mary went to **his hometown** due to the census (v. 3-4). That means Joseph likely had relatives in Bethlehem to stay with.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Jewish hospitality customs would have made it a **scandal** for relatives to turn away a pregnant Mary.

Therefore, the events likely unfolded like this:
1. Luke 2\:1-5: Joseph and Mary traveled to Bethlehem for the census, way before Mary was due to give birth (or at least there was no rush). They arrived and stayed with Joseph's relatives.
2. Luke 2\:6\: They stayed there until it was time for Mary to give birth.
3. Luke 2\:7: With the house full of relatives and visitors for the census, there was no room in the _guest room_ (`καταλύματι`) so Mary went to the lower part of the house, which was the 'stable' area where animals were kept, with a manger for feeding.

> [!NOTE]  
> More details on what the "manger" and "stable" could be will be covered in another article.

4. Luke 2\:8-20: The shepherds got the news from the **angel** and visited the newborn Jesus.

> [!TIP/FUN FACT]  
> Only one angel appeared and spoke to the shepherds before a multitude of angels appeared to praise God (in verse 13). I just want to write this here because this keeps popping up in Christmas quizzes.

Also, no wise men (Magi) were present here. They arrived later, as described in Matthew 2. I hope to cover who the Magi may be in another article.

5. Luke 2\:22: Likely on the 41st day after Jesus' birth (Leviticus 12), they went from Bethlehem to Jerusalem. The trip is about 5 miles (8km) and would take around half a day at most.

6. Luke 2\:39: Either interpretation seems fine to me:
- They returned to Nazareth, then came back to Bethlehem later during the visit of the Magi. I think this is more plausible and matches the plain reading of this verse.
- Luke simply skipped over the Egypt part and jumped to when they settled in Nazareth.

## Whence camest thou, innkeeper?

> [!WARNING]  
> I will admit I needed an AI assistant to help me find the earliest source of the "innkeeper" detail so I may be wrong here but hey, they are just a better search engine if I verify the sources, right? On a serious note, do you know any earlier source than what I found? Please let me know.

Apparently the "inn" and "innkeeper" details did not appear in any writing before the 14th century, from plays like [York Mystery Plays](https://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/) (c. 1370-1400) and [The N-Town Plays](https://metseditions.org/read/er3y7rpTWMDwt7xmc4AbptENW30GjXL) (c. 1460). The story seems to have become popularized through these plays across Europe. Soon, paintings followed suit, then Victorian (1800-1900s) churches had nativity scenes with the inn and innkeeper as standard elements. Our favorite hymns like "O Little Town of Bethlehem" and "Away in a Manger" further cemented this narrative.

### Retractions

Before writing this article, I used to rely on the points below but based on the research for this article, I no longer believe them to be accurate:

- Jews would not have stayed in commercial inns due to ritual purity laws: we have "The Parable of the Good Samaritan" and Rabbinic literature suggesting that Jews can stay in commercial inns, even if they are owned by Gentiles.
- Mary had to give birth in the stable due to uncleanness: records indicate women could give birth in the house and did not need to be isolated in a stable.
